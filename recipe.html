    <h2>The ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The steps:</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>Pour the sugar into a skillet over medium heat. Stir the sugar continually until it begins to brown and
            clump together. Keep stirring until the sugar completely melts and dissolves into a golden-brown syrup.
            Remove the syrup from the heat as soon as it has dissolves as it can burn.</li>

        <li>Working quickly, carefully pour the caramel into a 7-inch round pan or a special flan pan
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Casita-Flanera-Original-Flan-Maker/dp/B00KIA4QX4">(flanera)</a> as shown
            in the photos in the blog post. Pour the caramel evenly into the bottom of the pan so the entire bottom is
            coated. If you need to, use an oven mitt or potholders to move the pan from side to side to get the caramel
            evenly distributed. If the caramel hardens too quickly, you can carefully reheat the pan by placing it
            directly on the stove or on the skillet for a few seconds.
        </li>
        <li>Set the caramel-coated pan aside to cool and harden.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, add the eggs, sweetened condensed milk, whole milk and vanilla extract. Whisk
            together until everything is fully combined, but try not to overwhisk so that there aren't too many air
            bubbles in the mixture. </li>
        <li>Pour the custard mixture into the caramel-coated pan. Cover the top of the pan with the lid (if using a
            flanera) or tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Place the flan pan in a large baking dish and pour enough water in the dish until it reaches about halfway
            up the pan. Carefully place the baking dish in the oven and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the flan pan in a large baking dish and pour enough water in the dish until it reaches about halfway
            up the pan. Carefully place the baking dish in the oven and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once it's cooled, cover with the lid or aluminum foil and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>To serve, remove the lid or aluminum foil and slide a knife along the edges of the pan to loosen it up.
            Place a plate or platter on top of the flan, grab a hold of both the plate and the pan and quickly and
            securely flip it over so that the flan is now upside down. Carefully lift off the flan pan. Your flan should
            be sitting in the caramel on the plate, ready to enjoy! </li>
        <li>Carefully lift the flan pan up. The flan should be on the plate if it's not, place the pan back down and
            let it sit for a few minutes. Don't freak out! It will loosen up and slide out. You could try tapping the
            sides of the pan a bit or even giving the sides a squeeze.</li>
        <li>Slice the flan and serve with the rich caramel sauce! </li>
